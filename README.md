# Data Mining and Analysis in Python

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used for scraping and analyzing car data in Hebrew. The notebooks demonstrate web scraping with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building with `scikit-learn`.

## Notebooks

- `summary_assignment_part2.ipynb` &ndash; summary exercise showcasing data preprocessing and regression modeling.
- `matala1_kriya.ipynb` &ndash; earlier exercise that collects car listings from the web and builds a dataset.

## Usage

These notebooks were created with Python 3. To explore the analysis, open them with JupyterLab or another notebook viewer. Some cells require an active internet connection for scraping.
